/**
 * Material 3 Expressive Motion Scheme.
 *
 * Per the Expressive spec, motion is driven by SPRING PHYSICS (mass / stiffness
 * / damping) rather than fixed cubic-bezier easing. Springs give the
 * "overshoot & squeeze" cadence — the value can rush toward the target, sail
 * slightly past it, then settle back with organic, rubbery elasticity.
 *
 * We expose a small set of named springs so every animated surface in the app
 * shares one coherent, tuned feel:
 *
 *  - [spatial*]  — for things that move / resize / morph (position, size, shape).
 *                  Lower stiffness + a touch of bounce = visible elasticity.
 *  - [effects*]  — for non-spatial properties (alpha, color). Critically damped,
 *                  no bounce, so fades stay calm and don't shimmer.
